In this project, I successfully implemented a multi-user blog, including:

1. allow visitor view posts;
2. allow signup/login and logout;
3. logged in user can post/edit/delete his/her posts, like/dislike/comment on other's posts;
4. logged in user can edit/delete his/her comments
5. view his/her posts.
